# Periodic-Table-using-Python
Introductin:


The project is fundamentally structured around a Python dictionary and is designed to offer comprehensive insights into naturally occurring elements. This dictionary contains crucial data such as the element's name, atomic number, atomic mass, relative atomic mass, periodic number, group number, and atomic symbol. These details are indispensable for comprehending the distinct properties and behaviors of each element.

The project utilizes conditional statements, specifically if, elif, and else, to provide users with the means to access information about elements. Users can input various queries, such as the atomic number, atomic symbol, element name, or the group or period to which the element belongs. Based on these queries, the project generates specific responses, rendering it a versatile and user-friendly tool for exploring elemental data.

It's important to emphasize that the project's core data structure is a Python dictionary, and it is tailored to offer information for elements with atomic numbers up to 40. This restriction aligns with the range of naturally occurring elements commonly encountered in scientific and chemical contexts.

In summary, this Python dictionary-based project serves as an invaluable resource for individuals interested in gaining a deep understanding of the essential properties and characteristics of natural elements. It functions as a practical and accessible resource for accessing data from the periodic table, catering to the needs of students, researchers, and enthusiasts in the field of chemistry and related disciplines.



Periodic Table Guide

Welcome to our Periodic Table Guide! This Python program provides you with a convenient way to access information about various chemical elements from the periodic table. Whether you're a student, a researcher, or simply curious about the elements, this guide has you covered. You can explore elements by their atomic number, atomic symbol, or element name. Additionally, you can view elements grouped together or organized by their respective periods.

How to Use:

1. Search by Atomic Number: Enter the atomic number of the element you're interested in, and you'll get detailed information about that element.

2. Search by Atomic Symbol: Input the atomic symbol (e.g., "H" for Hydrogen) to retrieve information about the corresponding element.

3. Search by Element Name: Type in the name of the element (e.g., "Hydrogen") in the correct format, and you'll receive information about that element.

4. Group-wise Display: If you want to explore elements within a specific group, enter the group number, and you'll see a list of elements belonging to that group.

5. Period-wise Display: Likewise, you can explore elements within a particular period by providing the period number, and the program will list those elements.

Usage:

- Follow the on-screen prompts, make your selection, and provide the required input.
- The program will display detailed information about the selected element(s) or group of elements.

Enjoy your exploration of the periodic table!
