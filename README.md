# Periodic-Table-using-Python
Introductin:
The Python program in question is primarily centered around the periodic table and aims to provide comprehensive information about naturally occurring elements. This includes key data such as the element's name, atomic number, atomic mass, relative atomic mass, periodic number, group number, and atomic symbol. These details are essential for understanding the unique characteristics and behaviors of each element.

The program is constructed using conditional statements, specifically if, elif, and else, to facilitate user access to elemental information. Users can input various queries, including the atomic number, atomic symbol, element name, or the group or period in which the element is situated. Depending on the query, the program generates specific responses, rendering it a versatile and user-friendly tool for exploring elemental data.

It is worth noting that the program is limited in scope, providing information for elements with atomic numbers up to 40. This limitation is consistent with the range of naturally occurring elements commonly encountered in scientific and chemical contexts.

Overall, this Python program serves as a valuable resource for individuals seeking to familiarize themselves with the fundamental properties and characteristics of natural elements. It functions as a practical and accessible resource for accessing data from the periodic table, catering to the needs of students, researchers, and enthusiasts in the field of chemistry and related disciplines.
